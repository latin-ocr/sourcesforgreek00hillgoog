PREFACE

Tau object of this book is primarily educational.
The student of history is too apt to study it not in the
light of ancient authorities, but in the reflections of
modern writers. He is hardly to blame. His ime as
a rule is short, and the vast majority of the ancient
authorities are only accessible at a considerable expen-
diture of trouble, and sometimes of money. Yet it is

only by a careful balancing of these authorities even
the most worthless) that the mind can be trained to
form an accurate estimate of their velue. Doubtless
it is unfair to judge the best of them in the excerpted
form in which they appear in this collection3 yet it
has seemed better to have them thus than not at all.

a certain number of them at hand for ready reference.

adopted, it is impossible to avoid expressinga certain
