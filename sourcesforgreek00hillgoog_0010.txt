amount of conviction; but, apart from this, the reader
has been left free in each case to choose his own
interpretation.

The title gives but arr approximate idea of the scope
of the work. The collection of sources has ceased
where Thucydides takes up his direct narrative, so
that the quarrel which precipitated the Peloponnesian
War has been excluded. An absolutely complete
collection of passages bearing on the history of the
Pentekontaetia would require many volumes, in which
all the authorities should be printed irr full, and art,
literature, and philosophy be represented along with
politice and biography. In default of this, an attempt
has been made to include such passages relating to the
former matters as most directly concern history in the
narrower sense of the word. Constitutional antiquities
have been similarly dealt with, and from the side of
historical development rather than with the object
of describing the actual working of the constitution.
The printing of the two great historiens and of the
Ἀθηναίων Πολιτεία has been dispensed With for want
of space, and because they can best be supplied from
the slrelves of those who are likely to consult this
work.

ln printing the inscriptions I have followed the
system adopted by Dittenberger in his Sylloge, as being,
with all its shortcomings, the best substitute fora

facsimile. Where possible, the texts of inscriptions
have been compared with faesimileS, and this will
account for occasional slight variatione from the trans-
literations which are given, for instance, in tho Gorgiae.
