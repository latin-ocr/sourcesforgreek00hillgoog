PREFACE. vii

The editions named in the Index Auctorem have not
been rigidly adhered to in all their readings,

The following signs have been consistently used in
the printing of the inscriptions :—

[ ] Enclosing letters supplied by conjecture, where there is room for
them on the original.

. . .. Each point representing s missing letter.

- - - Represeuting an uncertain number oi missing letters.

< > Euelosingletters which appear superfluously on the original.

l ) Euclosing conjectural emendations oi a blunder on the original.
Ι Markiug the end of sline.

In the case of literarp⁷ texts :-

Represeuts any number of words omitted as not material tc the
purposes of the quotation.

⁸ ⁸ ⁸ Represents a lacuna in the MS.

The signs used in the Didot edition of the Scholia
to Aristophanes have been retained ¹. The meaning of
the signs occurring in other passages will it is hoped
be clear without farther explanation.

It would take peges to express my thanks to the
authors oi various books which I have consulted.
Busolt's Gricchisclte Geschicbtc will be recognized by
all who know it as having been my chief guido.
Next to that, the superscriptionum Atticorum ought
perhaps to be mentioned My thanks are dus to
ΜΓ. O. J. Naef, of the Admiralty, for undertaking
a tedicus task-ths revision of the greater part of the
non-epigraphis texts. By his help a large number of
the errors which inevitably creep into awork of this
kind have been eliminated.

¹ Unsatisfactory as the text oi this edition may be, I have thought
better to employ it, us giving the whole scholia, than tc adopt Dr.
Rutherford’s recensiones the Ravenna scholia.
